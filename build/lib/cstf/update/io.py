"""This module provides functions for downloading structure files and managing superseded entries.

It includes utilities for:
- Downloading structure files (cif, pdb, mtz) from RCSB PDB with concurrent request limiting
  while archiving previous versions of downloaded files with timestamps.
- Removing directories of superseded PDB entries and updating their status in the dataframe.

Typical usage example:
    get ids and dataframe using update_pipeline.query.
    start = "2023-03-02"
    end = "2023-04-14"
    repo_path = Path.cwd().parent / "data"

    download_files(df, start, end, repo_path)
    delete_superseded(df, start, end, repo_path)
